On a recent business trip to NYC  I took along my two best friends from high school [60's]  and one of the shows we chose to see was PAJAMA GAME!   What a great choice!  Harry Connick was terrific -  the voice, the body,  the EVERYTHING!  And Kelli O'hara was terrific as well! Everything about the show is fun, the sets, the cast, the singing, the dancing.  Go see this show if you have the chance...I plan to take my 4-year old granddaughter later in the spring -  Definitely worth a 2nd look.
"Incident at Kickapoo Creek" is a documentary by R.C. Raycraft that chronicles the "Incident at Kickapoo Creek" rock festival held Memorial Day weekend 1970 in Heyworth, Illinois, a town of about 1,400.<br/><br/>David Lewis was a local farmer who decided to hold a rock festival on land he owned. Kickapoo Creek ran through the property and the site where the festival was to be held. Local law enforcement issued injunctions against Lewis in an attempt to keep the festival from happening but it went on anyway.<br/><br/>The concert featured performances from such names as B.B. King, Ted Nugent & The Amboy Dukes, REO Speedwagon (then a local bar band from Champaign, IL), and Canned Heat, among others.<br/><br/>Raycraft utilizes a combination of still photos and shaky 8mm film footage. The movie offers a fascinating glimpse of the clash of a midwestern community still trying to shake off the mores and conformity of the fifties, and the emerging counterculture.<br/><br/>Sadly, there is little footage of the bands and even less of the music, which leaves a hole in the complete narrative.<br/><br/>There are some priceless moments, however: flocks of kids bathing nude in the creek; a shot of several people, presumably townfolk, peeking over a row of bushes in an effort to catch a glimpse of the debauchery; two undercover police officers desperately trying to blend in with the rest of the crowd and standing out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Overall, a flawed but fascinating look at a unique time in America.
It is not only breathtaking character realisation but also scene planing , directing actors are some reasons of many to rate this movie as one of the masterpieces of Turkish movie.While It's almost "non" budget was giving no respite to its labours, it also was given a great creative skills them.I salute with a big respect all of them on behalf of Director-Screen Writer-Serdar Akar.
C.R.A.Z.Y. is a rare film. Wonderful, comic, beautiful, poetic, tragic, and more- it effectively captures the cultural norms and social atmosphere of Montreal in the late 70s. More importantly, it tells the  story of a suburban, working class family and their confrontation with the most formidable of challenges that could threaten any family's stability.<br/><br/>Brutally honest, morally visceral, and cleverly presented, C.R.A.Z.Y. will alter the meaning of the word, permanently, for anyone who is willing to accept that the most important foundations of family are love and acceptance.
When I passed this place many times, I couldn't imagine what I would find when I finally made reservations. What a find. Great service, atmosphere and food. The block may be nothing to write home about but the seafood dishes and steak are.
This poor excuse of a movie is just the latest in a line of message films that attempt to lead the "Great Unwashed" into the "light".  When will these people learn to make movies, not porpaganda pieces?  Probably never.
Tarnation, if nothing else, is a brutally disturbing work of art.  The genius of this film is in the texture and tone of its frames rather than storytelling.<br/><br/>Caouette?s visuals are both exhilarating and dangerous, much like the fastest rollercoaster ever constructed.  His Warholesque duplication of images, minimalist text narration, melting  screens, distorted views, and bleeding colors, depict the blistering swirl of an amoral world.<br/><br/>At every turn, Caouette conveys a childlike vulnerability and willingness to expose (in horrific detail) often tragic footage in a mind altering fashion.  While most people are inclined to deny ugly truths and block out painful memories, Caouette fearlessly documents his story with both eyes open.<br/><br/>Tarnation strikes a delicate balance between darkness and light yet always teeters on the brink of insanity.  It leaves the viewer with a strong sense of appreciation for Caouette's authentic vision of redemption and forgiveness.
Spielberg at his best? No!But good. Most entertaining, but not convincing.Look for details. Fifteen ways to kill Your victims.<br/><br/>Which weapon we choose today. Could?nt believe, that a professionial mossad-hit-team behave, like Mr. Spielberg present the fascinated audience. The Munich massacre  during the olympics and his  backgrounds is only the trailer for the whole mess.
'End of the Spear' preaches one thing: save the savages from killing each other. As if they did not know this better. The huaorani (not waodani, which is an unfortunate anglicanization) are not just primitive individuals killing each other in order to survive the harsh life in the Amazon. They are a rich culture. They have a vast knowledge of medicinal plants, and have lived in harmony with their ecosystem for centuries. Shouldn't we be the ones learning and begging to be preached by their ways and costumes?<br/><br/>The film ommits that the huaorani live in regions of Ecuadorian Amazon highly priced by their huge oil reserves. May it have been adequate to tame the 'savages' in this region, not only for the interest of the Ecuadorian government but for international oil corporations? Well, let missionaries do the job.<br/><br/>Especially ironic were Mincayani's last remarks of his visit to the US, where he observes 'fat' people, food in supermarkets, credit cards, automobiles, lighting....and I now ask to myself, did Minkayani ever realize that the oil which is extracted from his own backyard is supporting us all in our massive desire of commodity and 'modern' culture?<br/><br/>This movie reflects a lame representation of the huaroni, and is offensive to their culture and knowledge. I suggest watching the documentary 'Pueblos ocultos en peligro' by Ana Echandi and Aritz Parra for a more realistic represantation of these cultures within the socio-political context of the region.
Run, don't walk, to see this show!  Harry is a quadruple threat - sings, dances, acts, AND plays a mean piano in Hernando's Hideaway.  I'd love to see THAT number again.<br/><br/>Energetic and fun....the whole cast is terrific, and I'm so glad I got a chance to see it.
My wife and I saw this marvelous play on Sunday, January 30 and we have not stopped talking about it since.  The performances of Nelson Avidon and Cheryl Leibert were absolutely mesmerizing.  Their superb acting and the extraordinary true-to-life dialogue conceived by the playwright (also Mr. Avidon) have resulted in our discussing their characters in the play as though they are real people we know and care about deeply.  This is one of the most memorable events we have experienced in our many years of attending shows.  ?Girl In Heat? is theater at its best - exhilarating, moving and truly unforgettable.
This is a wonderful show.  Yes, the singing and dancing are fantastic - top-rate performances all around.  But please while handing out kudos, don't forget Kathleen Marshall.  She's like the party girl of B'way musical revivals.  Everyone has such a great time at one of her shows. I snagged a tkt  the instant I saw she was directing.  Anyway, I am panting for a cast CD and humming Hernando's Hideaway while I wait.  There's a tour de force bit worked into that number.  WOW!  Four stars only because sets are dopey and the performance was over-miked the night I saw it. Besides it's only a revival. Overall, a lovely experience.
I loved this moved when it came out in 1987.<br/><br/>Even my daughters loved it. I would like to see it again or to buy the movie but I can't seem to find it.<br/><br/>What other movies did Viveka Davis make and also Todd Field ? I have'nt seen either of them in anything else. if anyone knows where I can purchase " Student Exchange" Let me know. Excellent movie!!
Finally after numerous phone message to our one local LDS owned/operated movie theater, I was able to view this nominated film.<br/><br/>Anticipation towards the films subject matter had not detoured us from anxiously waiting to view this little film. My friends and I absolutely loved Brokeback. I was probably most surprised and moved by the power and longevity of their love. And also by those women who loved them...and lost them. Brokeback gives the viewer few moments to reflect on a scene before pulling your heart into more saddness. This movie stayed with me long after the drive home.<br/><br/>Thankfully we were able to enjoy the film with peace and respect...very little giggling by the homophobic nuckle-dragging LDS hometown football players who attended with their girl friends probably hoping to see salacious sexual situations. They were most likely confused and disappointed.<br/><br/>Signed:<br/><br/>Single mother living in conservative<br/><br/>Twin Falls, Idaho.
I truly do not know what the hype is about with this movie. After hearing and reading so many good things I decided to watch it despite the fact that I was extremely skeptical about the cast. Now I still remain skeptical about most performances but, more than that, I am disappointed at this collage of uninteresting, unresolved stories, which build upon a series of extremely random coincidences, as if only ten people lived in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Interweaving several stories within two hours is a high task and this movie does not deliver. Whoever finds it deep and meaningful is, in my opinion, letting himself be carried away by the intense (and some times gratuitous) racial controversy and the easy, overly done drama.<br/><br/>The music does not help either as we have to listen to (what sounded to me like) the same song over and over, while the camera skips from one character to the next.<br/><br/>If you do not care about true, original art, watch this movie and you will find it perfectly pleasant. Otherwise put aside an additional hour and watch Magnolia again.
... but don't tell them about it before you show it to them!<br/><br/>I liked it so much I checked around the internet and found out what some reviewers said... wow...<br/><br/>DVD SAVANT<br/><br/>Reviewed by Glenn Erickson<br/><br/>They Shoot Movies, Don't They? becomes kind of a reality cinema Citizen Kane... the mock-umentary becomes sort of a Death of a Salesman.

Mike Leigh?s work is not for everyone. I wouldn?t expect those that enjoy Cats and Spring time for Hitler to understand the depth and extraordinary complexity of a Mike Leigh play. It?s the kind of work rightly appreciated by an actor like Jennifer Jason Leigh. whose talent, dedication to craft and commitment to hard work are traits defined by her performance. In her Broadway career Ms Leigh continues to pick work that is incredibly well written giving very pleasurable performances. JJL?s ?star? has never been about fortune or fame but about "the work? and this is just another example of her selflessness for her craft.
The New World is the second film I have ever walked out on.  The trailer for the film made it look so interesting and yet the film itself is  BORING!!!  While visually beautiful (kudos to the cinematographer) the story is empty and cliche.  The edits made are unilluminating, in most cases, I couldn't figure out what the scenes had to do with anything in the story.  And my biggest problem with the film is the sexploitation of the young girl playing Pocohontas.  I am sure that real Native women did not go about their daily toils in a one-shoulder, skin tight deer skin dress and I am equally sure that in the winter months they did not have thigh-high boots with exposed upper thighs and buttocks.
Huck and Holden is a hilarious play that compares the life of an Indian immigrant to the life of a regular American. He explores the life he never had but have always wanted and finds himself longing for a relationship with the librarian. His ignorance and timidness contrasts the librarian's loud and confident attitude, making them such an awkward couple. This inturn makes his courtship humourus.
The Bible is correct when it says, "But the natural man recieves not the things of God, they are foolish to him and he does not understand them because they are spiritually discerned." And that is because the person who wrote the first review missed the point. Yes, this movie is about forgiveness and yes, the music was great, but the story is from the Bible, a part called "The Prodigal Son", a son who took off to fulfill his own desires and live as he wanted to and in the end he just came back to where he originated and took it from there. It is what we call a Christian who "backslides" and God and man do forgive him of everything and they can start off fresh. Another point worth mentioning is the boys who saw "David" at the gym and had a sample for him to listen to, "David" told them to meet him at church and at the end, the 'leader' gave his life to Christ. The end is just testimonies of where these people ended up after all was said and done. Now, was that too hard? No, it is that plain and simple. Give this movie the credit that it deserves because the writers could've just threw "David" out on his rump as the world would want it, but no, they stuck to the Truth here and did what we are all told to do...forgive.
It was refreshing to see a film without all the hollywood hoopla or special effects interfering with the story itself. The begining of the movie is actually a part from the middle, the film makes you pay attention as different segments of the story are told. The actors are mostly young and likable. The country side in which most of the shots are filmed evokes thought of the wide open Texas plains. The music is eclectic and fast paced. It is a gritty indie film with drama and action that was most enjoyable.
